//this is a comment in java script
//the rules for naming a variable is same as any other programming language
//Js has 3 primary classification of variables as - var, let, const
//var variables are global variables, where as let and const are block scoped varaibles
// const variable values can't be changed once declared
// console.clear()
var a=5;
console.log(a)
a+=1
console.log(a)
b=false
console.log(b, typeof b)
//here typeof is used to specify that what category does the variables fall under



//object in JS is ntg but a dict as in python ex:
 let collection={
    na:"Aniket",
    "my roll":"y9",  //here as i have the space in the variable name so i put it in the string
    cgpa:9.9 //here object is ntg but key value pairs
}
collection.year=2; //this is how we add further key values and keys must be unique else the value for that specific key is overwritten
console.log(collection)
