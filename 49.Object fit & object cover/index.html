            /* object-position aligns the image within its container.
            If the image is larger than the container and object-fit is set to a value like cover or none, then:
            top right ensures that the top-right portion of the image is displayed in the container.
            The rest of the image (outside the container) will be cropped.
            It does not move the image's position relative to the container; it only adjusts what part of the image is visible. */

            /* note--->
            If the image is cropped, the visible part will be the top-right portion of the original image.
            If the image is smaller or fits perfectly, the alignment won't cause croppingâ€”it will just align the image's top-right corner to the container's top-right corner. */

            object-position: 10px 30px;
            /* this helps in setting the image as per our wish instead of px we can also use % also, basically positioning the image*/
