        // it help  to change any element and text inside an element

        // for example i can change the background color of the body 
        document.body.style.backgroundColor="thistle"
        // this gets added as inline css and overrides the other css if appiled for the same tag/component/element
        // that is when u inspect, u will see that the body has an inline css of style: color=thistle
