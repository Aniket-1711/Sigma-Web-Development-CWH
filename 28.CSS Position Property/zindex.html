<!-- necessary condition for z-index is :
 1.it must have position other than static
 
 2. the content must be capable to overlap-->

<!-- to see the effect we better don't use margin or use a margin that would atleast overlap the content to see z-index -->

<!-- if the element has the z-index >=the z-index or prev element then it will overlap -->
